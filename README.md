# Southeast Scoreboard

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/joraio/Scoreboard/_apis/build/status/joescars.USSEScoreboard)](https://dev.azure.com/joraio/Scoreboard/_build/latest?definitionId=4)

This is a generic tool built to help manage commitments and goals for our team. It has a custom structure based on a changing set of rules. 

The main goal of this tool is to allow us to view a "scoreboard" giving us instant feedback as to where we stand as a team. 

Feel free to use the code to build a similar tasks / goal setting tool.
