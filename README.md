# US South East Scoreboard

This is a generic tool built to help manage commitments and goals for our team. It has a custom structure based on a changing set of rules. 

The main goal of this tool is to allow us to view a "scoreboard" giving us instant feedback as to where we stand as a team. 

Feel free to use the code to build a similar tasks / goal setting tool.
